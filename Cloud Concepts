Cloud Computing: It's the delivery of computing services over the internet, which is otherwise known as the cloud. 
                 These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. 
                 Cloud computing offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
                 
Pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:
->Lower your operating costs.
->Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
->Scale as your business needs change.

Azure: Microsoft cloud computing platform. It supports IaaS, PaaS, SaaS. It provides services such as Virtual machines runnung on the cloud. Website and database hosting.
       Advanced computing services like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, IoT. Pay-as-you-go: you only pay for the computing time you use. It allows Cloud based storage. 
       Azure Web apps: provides scalable hosting platform. It is easy to deploy , operate and scale your apps in fully managed environment.
       Azure functions: Create event driven serverless applications with no coding required. 
       Azure Container Instances(Kubernetes Services): It allows you to deploy containarised applications with fully managed services.
       Azure offers fully managable relational and In memory databases. CosmosDB provides support for several NoSQL API's.
       
       Infrastruce management, scalability , availability and security are handled for you to save money and time.  
  
The Azure portal is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools. With the Azure portal, you can manage your Azure subscription by using a graphical user interface. You can:
->Build, manage, and monitor everything from simple web apps to complex cloud deployments.
->Create custom dashboards for an organized view of resources.
->Configure accessibility options for an optimal experience.

Azure Marketplace: It helps connect users with Microsoft partners, independent software vendors, and startups that are offering their solutions and services, 
                   which are optimized to run on Azure. Customers can find, try, purchase, and provision applications and services from hundreds of leading service providers. 
                   All solutions and services are certified to run on Azure.
